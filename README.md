# heart_disease_prediction_ML

# I. INTRODUCTION
In this project, we will be building a heart disease prediction
website which gives result for the data entered.We use an
online dataset which contains some medical information of
patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack
chance is less or more. Using the information explore the
dataset and classify the target variable using different Machine
Learning models and find out which algorithm suitable for this
dataset and find the most accurate model.We use that model
in our webpage to predict whether the given new data has a
heart disease or not.
